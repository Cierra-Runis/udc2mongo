# udc2mongo

## Description

This project is a Go project that reads data from a UDC (Universal Data Collection) XML file and writes it to a MongoDB database.

It is designed to facilitate the migration of data from UDC format to MongoDB.

## Plan

- Provide full models for UDC and MongoDB in Go
- Support other languages, such as Rust, Dart, and Kotlin in the future
